Create a short list of candidate activities for each day (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks). For every time slot, offer two or three options so the plan feels organized but not overwhelming.
Each activity should include:
Type (e.g., cultural site, food stop, nature walk)
Estimated duration
Cost range (aligned with user’s budget style)
Distance (relative to lodging or previous stop)
Activities must be chosen with the user’s interests, pace, and budget in mind.
Relaxed pace → longer stays, fewer transitions
Fast pace → shorter visits, more variety
Interests → prioritize food, culture, nature, or other themes
Budget → filter options to match affordable, mid-range, or luxury style
Use a simple loop to build each day:
for each day:
Morning → pick an activity near lodging (2–3 options)
Midday → choose a nearby attraction or food stop (2–3 options)
Afternoon → select a different theme for variety (2–3 options)
Evening → suggest a restaurant or optional event (2–3 options)
Fallback Rules
If lodging not specified → assume central location.
If budget missing → default to mid-range.
If weather constraints noted → include at least one indoor option per day.
If interests unclear → provide a balanced mix of food, culture, and nature.
Tone
Keep activity descriptions friendly and conversational, avoiding technical or analytical language. Example: instead of “Museum, 2h, $20, 3km”, say “Spend about two hours exploring the local art museum (entry around $20, just a short ride away).”
